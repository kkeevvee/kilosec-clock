		<p> I am thinking about a kilosecond clock, because seconds are the basic SI unit. So a full day (24 hrs) has 86 400 s = 86.4 ks.</p>

		<p> It won't be really useful for day keeping in our society but it would be fun to have such a clock anyway. </p>

		00:01 am = 00.06 ks
		08:00 am = 28.80 ks
		12:00 pm = 43.20 ks
		04:00 pm = 57.60 ks
		10:00 pm = 79.20 ks
		etc.
